  <p>
    The Pocket Hotline API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using GET requests.
    Every resource, like User or Call, has
    their own URL and are manipulated in isolation. In other words, we've tried
    to make the API follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>
    principles as much as we can.
  </p>

  <h2>Authentication</h2>
  <p>
    Authentication is managed using HTTP authentication.
    Every request must include the Authorization HTTP header. Use your API token as the username,
    and "X" (or some otherwise bogus text) as the password (only the API token is used for
    authenticating API requests). Example with Curl:
  </p>
  <pre style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><code>curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -u myapitoken:X https://#{account.subdomain}/calls.json</pre></code>
  <p>
    Your API token can be found by logging into your Pocket Hotline account, clicking on the "My Info" link
    in the upper-right, and then clicking the "API Tokens" at the bottom.
  </p>

  <h2>Making requests</h2>
  <p>
    Be sure to set both the 'Content-Type' and 'Accept' headers to 'application/json' to
    identify the request and response format. Example with Curl:
  </p>

  <pre style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><code>curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -u myapitoken:x \
  https://#{account.subdomain}/calls/123.json</pre></code>

  <h2>Responses</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>If a request succeeds, it will return a status code in the 200 range</strong> and
    often, an JSON-formatted response.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If a request fails, a non-200 status code will be returned</strong>, possibly with
    error information in JSON format as the response's content. For instance, if a requested
    record could not be found, the HTTP response might look something like:
  </p>

  <pre style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><code>HTTP/1.1 404 The record could not be found
  Date: Thu, 16 Mar 2012 17:41:40 GMT
  ...</code></pre>

  <!-- <h2>Rate limiting</h2>
  <p>
    You can perform up to 500 requests per 10 second period from the same IP address for the
    same account. If you exceed this limit, you'll get a 503 response for subsequent requests.
    Check the Retry-After header to see how many seconds to wait before trying again.
  </p> -->

  <h2>SSL</h2>
  <p>
    All requests must be over SSL using urls beginning with https.
